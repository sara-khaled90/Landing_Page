# Landing Page Project

I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.


## languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript Version: ES2015/ES6

## Description
I used java script to   
and add functionality to scroll to section.  
add functionality to distinguish the section in view and added an active state to navigation items when a section is in the viewport.   
Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling.  
Add a scroll to the top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.   

I used HTML & css to   
add a button to scroll to the top.  
change the active section gradient.  

I made sure that the page is resposive across all devices, such as modern desktops, tablets, and phone browsers.
